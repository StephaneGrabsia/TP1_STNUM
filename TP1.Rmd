title: "R Notebook"
output: html_document

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

# First Part
 
```{r}
painting8 <- read.table("painting8.txt", sep = ";", dec = ":")
painting64 <- read.table("painting64.txt", sep = ";", dec = ":")
painting8$peintre <- as.factor(c(rep("R",40), rep("VG",44)))
painting64$peintre <- as.factor(c(rep("R",40), rep("VG",44)))
```

## Question 1

```{r}
var(painting8)
var(painting64)
```

## Question 2
```{r}
P <- ggplot()
geom_boxplot()

```

## Question 3
```{r}
install.packages("GGally")
library(GGally)
ggpairs(painting8)
